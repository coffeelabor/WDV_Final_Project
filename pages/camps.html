    <h1>
        OUR SPRING AND SUMMER SURF CAMP AND CALIFORNIA SURF SCHOOL IS A GREAT WAY FOR KIDS AND TEENS TO LEARN OCEAN SAFETY WHILE
        HAVING FUN SURFING!
    </h1>
    
    <p>
        Exclusively available at WAVES, our seasonal Surf Camps are perfect for kids and teens aged 5 to 17. We’ve been
        operating since 2002, and our intensive half-day or full-day surf school sessions help students build confidence and
        improve their skills quickly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
        Here’s how Surf Camp works:
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        Choose your session: Spring Break (March-April) or Summer Break (June-September)
        Choose your duration: We offer full-day (9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.) and half-day (9:30 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., or 12:45 p.m. to
        3:30 p.m.) sessions
        Take advantage of our flexible scheduling: Sign up for as many or as few half days, full days, or weeks as you like
        We provide free childcare from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m., with an extended childcare option spanning 8:00 a.m. until
        5:00 p.m.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Everything is provided, including safe, comfortable foam surfboards as well as bodyboards and full-length and spring
        wetsuits. Snacks and drinks are offered at no extra charge, and we also put up canopies to provide shade from the
        Southern California sun and prevent excess sun exposure.
